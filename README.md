# Dissertation
Code for the dissertation project "Water consumption measuring system using Sigfox", presented in July 2017 @ FEUP. 
All the code was developed by me, from the MCU to the Android App (a first) to the server (PHP).

The MCU was a MSP430G2, programmed in C using the Code Composer Studio IDE. 
For the app, I used Android Studio IDE to make it and tested it on my Huawei CUN-L01, running Android 5.1.
For the server, I used PHP and I hosted it on a free Heroku server.
